This project focuses on solving a real-world computer vision problem using Python, specifically targeting the classification of a flower type known as "La Eterna" from various other flowers. The code utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Tensorflow/Keras libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the models is available in the `data_cleaned/Train` directory. It includes images of "La Eterna" flowers and other types of flowers.
## Code Structure

- `Challenge-Final.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code for building and training the CNN models.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages. Install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
